In this study, we investigated the determinants of diabetes disease, as well as the impact of diabetes on other health conditions, based on data collected from a field sample survey of 915 diabetic patients in Bangladesh between October 2015 and January 2016.

A single questionnaire was used for data collection in the field. This questionnaire included basic information about the patient, including gender, marital status, age, weight, family history, causes of diabetes, controlling high blood sugar, treatment and exercise for diabetes, etc.

Our study used three models: a Poisson model to determine the number of family members with diabetes, a negative binomial model to determine how often patients check blood glucose, and a multinomial logistic model for cause and type of diabetes.

In our study, weâ€™ve tried to investigate the causes of diabetes as well as the different factors that cause diabetes. We also tried to find the effect of diabetes on other diseases like obesity, overweight, mental pressure, eye problem, kidney problem, heart diseases, etc. Our study found that diabetes is caused by foods with high cholesterol, sedentary lifestyles, smoking, hypertension, and genetic factors.
